# Rock, Paper, Scissors Image Classification

## Overview
This code is designed for image classification of the Rock, Paper, Scissors dataset. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for training and prediction.

## Environment Setup
The necessary libraries and modules, such as NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and others, are imported to ensure a proper working environment.

## Dataset Retrieval
The Rock, Paper, Scissors dataset is downloaded and extracted from a specified URL. The dataset is organized into directories for training and validation.

## Load Datasets
The dataset is loaded into the Colab environment, and directory paths are set for further processing.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed by splitting it into training and validation sets. Subdirectories for each class (rock, paper, scissors) are created within the training and validation directories. Images are then copied to their respective class directories.

## Image Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is performed on the training dataset using the ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow's Keras API. This process helps enhance the model's ability to generalize by applying random transformations to the input images, such as rotation, horizontal flip, and shear.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
The CNN model is defined using the Sequential API of Keras. It consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flattening layer, and dense layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.

## Model Training
The model is trained using the fit method with the training and validation datasets. An early stopping callback is implemented to monitor the training progress and prevent overfitting.

## Prediction
The trained model is used for making predictions on new images uploaded by the user. The uploaded images are preprocessed, and the model predicts whether the input corresponds to rock, paper, or scissors.
